### Quick Introduction
As a Dungeons and Dragons fanatic, I decided to build this digital character sheet as a personal passion project. 

I started this project in the winter of 2022, after several months into my software engineering internship at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where my work focused mainly on web-application development. I enjoyed (and still enjoy) working with JavaScript, React, and HTML, so I decided to make my own web application to enhance those skills. 

This character sheet utilizes React to save data state when entering new information, for instance, when a user creates a new Attack weapon card. And to save and load all pertinent data, with each new addition or verified update to the character sheet, the application saves and loads that updated information to local storage as a JSON object. Using local storage also allows the user to save and load their entire character sheet to and from their personal computer as a JSON file.

*Further updates to this README will include additional screenshots of the various character sheet functionalities (such as death saving throws) and screen recordings to showcase the several multi-select boxes in the bottom-right corner of the character sheet. 

### Running the Application
The project is a React application, therefore to run the application: 
1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Run `npm install` terminal to download all necessary dependencies.
3. Finally, enter `npm run start` to run the application on your local host.
